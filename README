Current Awesome Stats:
(These stats are skewed because they include ALL of the plugins,
which could easily be separated out of core)

Awesome is awesome because it loads almost instantly, allowing you to 
perform common JavaScript tasks without annoying load-time lag. My 
goal is to perform as many common jQuery and plugin methods as possible 
while keeping the compressed/gzipped source size under 5kb.

Read example.js or see the wiki for implementation examples!
